# Address Book with KnockoutJS

This is a step by step tutorial to learn knockoutJS.

## Why
To become a great Web Developer, you must be able to work with the latest
technologies and frameworks. KnockoutJS is part of a new generation of frameworks
that make frontend development much more easier, just like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org).
These frameworks let you dynamically bind data with html elements.

## User Stories

As a user, I must be able to view my contact list, with first and last name, and phone numbers.

As a user, I must be able to add a new contact with all his information.

As a user I must be able to delete contacts from my address book.

As a user I must be able to add and remove phone numbers to any individual contact.

As a backend developer, I must receive all the address book contacts as a JSON so I can store
it in a database.
